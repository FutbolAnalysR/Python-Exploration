    "# Installing the Statsbomb Python Library\n",
    "\n",
    "I have started using Python more and wanted to find away of creating Jupyter notebooks on VS Code and converting them to Markdown files for my Blogdown created in R Studio. Didn't take me long to find a really simple tutorial on how to easily do this. For this tutorial, I am also going to download and install the Statsbomb Python library, using a zip folder I have downloaded from their [github page](https://github.com/statsbomb/statsbombpy).  \n",
    "\n",
    "Before I get started, I like to work with Jupyter Notebooks within my VS Code environment. This might not be normal, I'm not sure but for those that are interested you can find how to implement this on your device [here](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/jupyter-support). For this type of environment, my terminal working directory is always pointed to where the current file is saved, or where my VS Code project is based. This makes it quite easy to use and direct to data files saved within the working directory.\n",
    "\n",
    "Once I have downloaded the statsbombpy zip file from github, I added this to my current Jupyter notebook working directory. In the terminal, I changed my working directory using cd statsbombpy-master, then ran pip install . to install the statsbombpy library successfully.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Now we have the library installed, let's see how easy it is to run and pull the free competitions in to our notebook. "
