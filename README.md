# Python Tutorials and Exploratory Analyses

The purpose of this repository is to create a centralised location for all tutorials I either follow and copy or create myself to help guide my Python learning. These are then applied in to exploratory analyses within this repository to apply techniques I learn through the tutorials. 

## Tutorials:

Topic | Tutorial | Aim of Tutorial
----- | -------- | ---------------
Data Cleaning | [Data Cleaning With Pandas](Tutorials/DataCleaningWithPandas.ipynb) | This tutorial follows a method of cleaning data using Pandas for Python. 
Matplotlib | [Basic Tutorial](Tutorials/MatplotlibBasicTutorial.ipynb) | This tutorial follows along with the Matplotlib basic usage tutorial on the Matplotlib website. 
Matplotlib | [Pyplot Tutorial](Tutorials/MatplotlibPyplotTutorial.ipynb) | A basic run through the basic usage terms of Matplotlib Pyplot from the Matplotlib website.

## Exploratory Analyses:
Topic | Packages | Aim
----- | -------- | ---
[London Bike Share](ExploratoryDataAnalysis/LondonBikeSharing.ipynb) | Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib | To explore the London Bikeshare dataset from Kaggle. 

## Machine Learning:
